1,Antiderivatives,What is an antiderivative?,"Let \(f(x)\) be continuous on \([a,b]\). If \(G(x)\) is continuous on \([a,b]\) and \(G'(x)=f(x)\) for all \(x\in (a,b)\), then \(G\) is called an **antiderivative** of \(f\). "
2,Antiderivatives,For what types of functions \( f \) does there exist an antiderivative \( G(x) \) such that \( G'(x) = f(x) \)?,The function \( f(x) \) must be continuous on the interval over which the antiderivative is to be defined.
3,Antiderivatives,How is the antiderivative for function \( f(x) \) constructed?,"We can construct antiderivatives by integrating. The function \[F(x)=\int^x_a f(t)\, dt\] is an antiderivative for \(f\) since it can be shown that \(F(x)\) constructed in this way is continuous on \([a,b]\) and \(F'(x)=f(x)\) for all \(x\in (a,b)\). "
4,Antiderivatives,"If \( F(x) \) is an antiderivative for \( f(x) \), then what functions are also antiderivatives for \( f(x) \)?","Let \(F(x)\) be any antiderivative for \(f(x)\). For any constant \(C\), \(F(x)+C\) is an antiderivative for \(f(x)\). This means when finding a definite integral you should **always write ""+ C""** to indicate that any constant can be added to yield a valid solution."
5,Antiderivatives,What is the form in which every antiderivative of \( f(x) \) can be written?,"Every antiderivative of \(f(x)\) can be written in the form \[F(x)+C\] for some \(C\). That is, every two antiderivatives of \(f\) differ by at most a constant. "
6,Antiderivatives,What is the value of \( \frac d {dx} \[ \int f(x)\ dx \] \)?,"\(\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}\left[\int\! f(x)\, dx\right]=f(x)\)."
7,Antiderivatives,How can \( \int [\alpha f(x) + \beta g(x) ]\ dx \) be rewritten?,"_(Linearity)_ \(\displaystyle \int [\alpha f(x)+\beta g(x)]\, dx=\alpha \int\! f(x)\, dx+\beta \int\! g(x)\, dx\). "
8,Arc length,"If \( f(x) \) is continuously differentiable on \( [a,b] \), then what is its arc length?","Let \(f(x)\) be continuously differentiable on \([a,b]\). Then the arc length \(L\) of \(f(x)\) over \([a,b]\) is given by \[L=\int^b_a \sqrt{1+[f'(x)]^2}\, dx.\]"
9,Arc length,What strategy is used to determine the arc length for a function?,"Divide the interval for the desired arc length into subintervals. For each subinterval compute the length of the straight line segment between the values of the function at the endpoints of this interval. The sum of these segments provides an approximation of the arc length. As the number of subintervals increases and  the length of the subintervals goes to zero, the approximation becomes exact for a continuously differentiable function."
10,Chain rule,What is the derivative for a composition of functions? ,"Letting \(y=f(g(x))\) and \(u=g(x)\), \(\) \frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy}{du}\cdot\frac{du}{dx}. \(\) Using alternative notation, \begin{align} \frac{d}{dx}\left[ f(g(x)) \right] & = & f'(g(x))g'(x), \\ \frac{d}{dx}\left[ f(u) \right] & = & f'(u)\frac{du}{dx}. \end{align} In words, the derivative of \(f(g(x))\) is the derivative of \(f\), evaluated at \(g(x)\), multiplied by the derivative of \(g(x)\). "
11,Chain rule,Is the composition of two differentiable functions differentiable?,Yes. Suppose a function \(g(x)\) is differentiable at \(x\) and \(f(x)\) is differentiable at \(g(x)\). Then the composition \(f(g(x))\) is differentiable at \(x\). 
12,Computing integrals by completing the square,When is partial fractions not a viable option for evaluating the integral of a fraction?,"When the denominator does not factor with rational coefficients, partial fractions is not a viable option."
13,Computing integrals by completing the square,What types of integrals can be evaluated by the method of completing the square?,"Integrals of fractions that cannot be computed with partial fractions, such as when the denominator does not factor with rational coefficients or the denominator involves a square root, but can be written in the form of an antiderivative of a trig function or another known form."
14,Computing integrals by completing the square,How is the quadratic polynomial \[ ax^2 + bx + c \] rewritten by completing the square?,"By completing the square, we may rewrite any quadratic polynomial \[ax^2+bx+x\] in the form \[a\left[(x+k_1)^2+k_2\right]\] where $k_1$ and $k_2$ may be positive or negative."
15,Computing integrals by substitution,What property allows the substitution method of computing integrals?,The substitution method amounts to applying the Chain Rule in reverse.
16,Computing integrals by substitution,How can an integral be computed with the substitution method?,"To compute \(\displaystyle\int\! f(g(x))g'(x)\, dx\), we let \(u = g(x)\) \(du = g'(x) dx\). Then \(\displaystyle{\int f(g(x))g'(x)\, dx = \int f(u)\, du = F(u) = F(g(x))}\) where \(F\) is an antiderivative of \(f\). The integral may not always be in the exact form that we started with here, but using the same idea, where we start with substituting in \(u\) or \(du\) until all of the \(x\) and \(dx\) terms are eliminated, should reduce the integral into something more easily solvable (if the substitution was applied appropriately)."
17,Continuity,When is a function continuous at a particular point?,"A function \(f\) is **continuous at \(c\)** if and only if \(\displaystyle\lim_{x\to c} f(x)=f(c).\)  That is, \(f\) is continuous at \(c\) if and only if for all \(\varepsilon > 0\) there exists a \(\delta > 0\) such that \[{\small\textrm{if }} |x-c|<\delta \quad{\small\textrm{then }} |f(x)-f(c)|<\varepsilon.\] In words, for \(x\) close to \(c\), \(f(x)\) should be close to \(f(c)\)."

(Specifically, if the left- and right-hand limits exist but are different, the discontinuity is called a **jump discontinuity**.) * \(f(x)\) has a limit as \(x\to c\), but \(\lim_{x\to c} f(x)\neq f(c)\) or \(f(c)\) is undefined. (This is called a **removable discontinuity**, since we can ""remove"" the discontinuity at \(c\) by redefining \(f(c)\) as \(\lim_{x\to c} f(x)\).) "

142,Algebra review,"What is the derivative of a polynomial (or, more generally, linear combination of powers of the variable of differentiation)?",**Power rule**: The derivative with respect to \(x\) for a sum of powers of \(x\) with real coefficients and exponents is given by \[\left( \sum^n_{k=0} a_k x^k\right)' = \sum^n_{k=1} ka_kx^{k-1}\]
143,Algebra review,"What is the integration of a polynomial (or, more generally, linear combination of powers of the variable of integration)?","**Power rule**: The integral with respect to \(x\) for a sum of powers of \(x\) with real coefficients and exponents is given by \[\int\!\left( \sum^n_{k=0} a_k x^k\right)\,dx= \sum^n_{k=0} \frac{a_k x^{k+1}}{k+1} + C.\]"
144,Algebra review,What is the derivative of a constant?,The derivative of a constant is always zero. 
145,LHopitals rule,How can the limit of an exponential function be found?,"The logarithm of the limit equals the limit of the logarithm, so taking the logarithm of the expression first, finding the limit, and then taking the answer as the exponent of \(e\) is often easier."
146,LHopitals rule,What is the first step for evaluating a limit for a rational function?,"See whether the expression in the limit simplifies. If so, you may be able to remove a singularity."
147,Limits,What is a left-hand limit?,A left-hand limit is the limit of a function as you approach it from the left. We write \[ \lim_{x\rightarrow c^-} f(x) \]
148,Limits,What is a right-hand limit?,A right-hand limit is the limit of a function as you approach it from the right. We write \[ \lim_{x\rightarrow c^+} f(x) \]
149,Limits,What is the definition of a limit?,"Let the function \( f(x) \) be defined at all \( x \) in an open interval containing \( c \), except possibly at \( c \) itself. Then the limit \[ \lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x) = L \] if and only if for each \( \epsilon > 0 \), there exists a \( \delta > 0 \) such that \[ \text{ if } 0 < | x - c| < \delta \text{ then } | f(x) - L | < \epsilon \] In words, this is equivalent to saying that the limit \[ \lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x) = L \] if and only if by taking \( x \) arbitrarily close to \( c \), we can get \( f(x) \) arbitrarily close to \( L \)."
150,Limits,When does a limit exist?,"A two-sided limit \( \lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x) = L \) exists if both the left- and right-hand limits exist, and are equal."
151,Limits,What is the limit of a function that has a vertical asymptote at the limit point?,"The limit is undefined, because the function tends to infinity."
152,Limits,What is the left-hand limit of a function with a jump-discontinuity at the limit point?,The limit is the value of the function on the left-hand side of the jump discontinuity.
153,Limits,What is the right-hand limit of a function with a jump-discontinuity at the limit point?,The limit is the value of the function on the right-hand side of the jump discontinuity.
154,Limits,What is the limit of a function with a jump-discontinuity at the limit point?,"The limit is undefined, because the left- and right-hand limits will have different values at the limit point (evaluated at the left- and right- hand side of the jump discontinuity)"
155,Limits,What is the left-hand limit of a function that has a removable discontinuity at the limit point?,"The limit is the value of the function as you approach from the left, but not the ""defined"" value of the function itself at the limit point."
156,Limits,What is the right-hand limit of a function that has a removable discontinuity at the limit point?,"The limit is the value of the function as you approach from the right, but not the ""defined"" value of the function itself at the limit point."
157,Limits,What is the limit of a function that has a removable discontinuity at the limit point?,"The limit is the value of the left/right hand limits. ""Removable discontinuity"" in fact gets its name from the fact that we can ""remove"" the discontinuity by defining the function at the limit point as the limit itself."
158,Limits,"What is the limit of a function with a horizontal asymptote, as \( x \rightarrow \pm\infty \)?",The limit is simply the value of the asymptote.
159,Limits,What is the limit of a function that tends to infinity as \( x \rightarrow \pm\infty \)?,"The limit is undefined, because the function tends to infinity."
