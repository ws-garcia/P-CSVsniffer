1,Attend a family reunion.,Whether your family fits in a minivan or can field a complete tackle-football team; there's something to be said for a reunion: a day or two dedicated to the pursuit of family connectedness; among relatives ordinarily separated by distance and by generations. Families are important support networks; emotionally and logistically; and it's just nice to stay close to them. ,Big families will often turn these into giant productions; complete with catering and organized events; but even a small family can find an excuse to come together. Make a home movie (your grandkids will laugh hysterically at it one day); have a celebratory dinner; or take a day-trip to a location important in your family history -- you might also find it effective to ditch the excuses and just spent a day in one another's company. Awesome! ,25,1
2,Attend live theatre.,There is nothing quite like live theatre. Whether you're watching a raucous musical; a cerebral drama; or an absurd experimental performance; the experience of watching live actors helps you appreciate what you're seeing on a level you just can't get with movies or television -- good theatre connects you emotionally to its characters and viscerally to its story. Maybe that's why the form has survived for literally thousands of years. ,In a big place like New York; London or L.A. this is easy; but there are opportunities to see theatre just about anywhere. You can be conventional and visit a touring Broadway show; although it's cooler to support local community theatre. If there's a college near you; there will almost certainly be tons of interesting - and often free - theatre happening there. ,10,1
3,Be grateful.,We live in an amazing world; filled with amazing people -- but amid all the trouble and heartache we face; we often miss the joys and blessings of everyday life. Change that: being grateful for even the smallest things can upend our emotional states and add a note of optimism to our days. ,"Whether it's through a religious tradition; a mindfulness meditation; or simply by saying ""thank you"" (to your family and friends; the everyday people you meet; or no one in particular); make an effort to be grateful for the good things in your life. Don't forget about the basics: food; water; shelter; and good company are all opportunities for gratitude. ",2,1
4,Be true to yourself.,Everybody's under pressure to be someone they're not. But unless you're an undercover agent; we're pretty sure that you don't have to be. So why let other people decide how you live? ,"Well; let's not take this to extremes. Maybe your true self really enjoys bunny-style pajamas; you still probably shouldn't wear them to work. BUT; there's always room in your life for you to let your true colors show. Choose to spend your time on things that you care about; not just whatever everyone else is doing -- in other words; don't stand in long lines just because there's a long line. Share your opinions; respectfully but forthrightly; and make sure your voice is heard. Pick a ""guilty pleasure"" song you really like; turn it up; and dance like nobody's looking. Or: ignore our instructions; and be yourself the way YOU want to! ",2,1
5,Bring your lunch.,Paying for lunch -- at work; at school; wherever -- is what financial experts call; to use the technical term; a big stupid waste of money; especially if you're looking to eat something more nutritious than a $1.99 cheeseburger. Don't be forced to choose between your wallet and your arteries: bring a healthy lunch with you instead. ,"There's something to be said for our old friend the sandwich -- but to prevent brown-bag boredom; get fresh and get creative. Even if you don't have access to a refrigerator; there's plenty you can do. Fruit or raw veggies should be a standby in every lunch (hint: the more colorful; the better); and complement them with a protein-rich; low-fat choice like poultry or broth-based soup. Don't go frozen unless you have to; processed foods like that are more expensive; less nutrient-dense; and even if they're labeled ""diet"" or ""low-fat"" often contain way more sodium and calories than you need. ",2,1
6,Build muscle strength.,"When you hear ""weight training;"" you might get a mental image of Saturday Night Live's Hans and Franz: ""We're going to PUMP. YOU UP."" Here's a better way to think about it: weight or strength training is exercise that targets muscle development to help you burn fat; gain stamina; and build bone density (particularly important for women and osteoporosis). Though it does generally require weight lifting; strength training can also incorporate exercises like push-ups; squats; and crunches. Even if you're already a cardio workout guru; you're only part way to a high-impact exercise routine. Everyone needs to incorporate strength training to build lean muscle before it becomes fat.",A gym's weight room can seem like Muscle Beach to a daunted beginner. If you're inexperienced with strength training; it probably makes sense to start your new routine with help from a personal trainer; or an experienced friend or family member. To get going; check out this guide to the basics from WebMD.,10,1
7,Buy in bulk.,"When was the last time you bought one toothpick? Probably never. If someone tried to sell you one toothpick for; let's say; five cents; you would probably go ""that's ridiculous. I can get a box of 100 toothpicks for one dollar. This is marked up by 500%!"" And then you'd slap him in the face. But: little do you know; this principle applies to just about everything you buy. Not so slap-happy now; are you? ","Whether you favor big cavernous membership-card stores; or an online solution (there are tons of bulk shopping sites online); successful bulk buying depends on research. Make sure the seller is trustworthy; the price actually saves you money; and that you actually need what you're buying: don't get saddled buying the world's largest crate of cotton balls just because it was ""only"" $25; or buying products that are going to expire before you can use them anyway. Also; be sure you have storage space for your bulk items. If you plan for all of that -- value; need; perishability; storage -- you'll save money. ",5,1
8,Call your parents.,Every sitcom in the world has already made jokes about this; so we're going to take the serious approach: when you're away from your parents; it's hard for them to feel connected to you; which is no fun because they love you. Calling them is a simple way to stay close -- sometimes an annoying imposition on you when you're trying to go out and do Young People Things; yes; but important nonetheless. ,"The key thing here is not to procrastinate. Especially if your parents are the type who like to have 45-minutes discourses about things like groceries; or the characters of NCIS; or when they can finally expect some grandchildren; it's easy to say ""heck with it; I'll call them tomorrow."" But ""tomorrow"" turns into several weeks very easily; and that'll make your parents sad. Do you want to make your parents sad? ",2,1
9,Clean the bathroom.,"All of your house needs cleaning; but the bathroom is a different beast altogether. If you think about everything that goes on in your bathroom over the course of a week -- or a month; EWWWWWWW -- you'll realize quickly that keeping it clean isn't just good hygiene and good housekeeping; it's necessary to prevent the feeling of being totally skeeved out every time you walk in there. (""Skeeved out"" is a scientific term; by the way.) ",De-skeeving your bathroom can be intimidating -- I have to scrub WHAT? -- but if you make it a regular habit and start slowly; you'll have a shiny bathroom in no time. Our friend the FlyLady supports the Swish and Swipe method; a daily 2-minute habit of wiping down your counter; faucet; sink; and toilet with surface/window cleaner and paper towels; then quickly scrubbing the inside of the toilet with a brush. Boom -- you're done; and your bathroom is fresh! Of course it's a good idea to clean the floors regularly (especially if you have kids or pets who tend to track things into and out of the bathroom) and do a deeper scrub now and then; but don't let periodic cleanings take the place of daily freshness. ,5,1
10,Clean up.,No matter how much you want it to; that mess won't clean itself up. (n.b. This does not apply if you are a wizard.) ,Every mess is different; but the approach is always basically the same: isolate the mess; grit your teeth; ATTACK THE MESS; and get it done. ,2,1
11,Clean your floors and carpets.,Floors are like roads for your feet. Imagine if you were driving your car down a road covered in nails; oil slicks; and clouds of dust -- you wouldn't have a very enjoyable drive; unless perhaps you are playing Mario Kart. The same principle applies in your home: clean floors are more hygienic; safer; and much more pleasant to walk on.,Carpets want to be vacuumed; floors want to be swept and/or mopped. There are a lot of intense and complicated ways to do this (and periodically; yes; it's good to steam-clean your carpets or use industrial clear-sludge cleaning goop on your floors); but basically anything that conveys dirt from your floors onto not your floors will suffice just fine. Don't underestimate the power of even a quick sweep-up to make your kitchen or hallway feel like a totally different room. ,5,1
12,Cook a meal.,We eat too much takeout. This is just a fact -- a big part of the obesity epidemic in the world today is that there's so much greasy; fat-laden; ludicrously over-portioned restaurant food out there; calling out to us with the promise of cheap; convenient calories. You can make a big difference in your diet; and bring your family together at the same time; by cooking at home instead. ,A lot of us are intimidated by the prospect of cooking anything more complicated than mac 'n' cheese. Don't be. You don't have to be Julia Child to make a delicious dinner in your home; things like roast chicken; grilled vegetables; pasta; and other classics are often surprisingly easy. The whole Internet is here to help you with this -- find a simple; healthy recipe you like; and get started! ,3,1
13,Cook with someone else.,They say that too many cooks spoil the broth; this is true in professional kitchens and in Metaphor Land. But in our everyday lives; for those of us whose cooking skills are more attuned to Chef Boy-Ar-Dee than Julia Child; a partner cooking alongside you is an absolute godsend. Being able to share a successful meal you've made together; even if one of you was just cluelessly sauteeing vegetables while the other one made everything else (hello; married couples); is a great way to bond.,You and your cooking partner can work together on interpreting recipes; preparing ingredients; stirring; straining; seasoning; and all the tasks of cooking that tax either your brainpower or your ability to multitask. Let the more experienced chef take the lead; but share opinions freely: it's good to have a reality check before dumping; let's say; garlic salt into a meal that already basically tastes like a salt lick. (A certain DailyFeats team member may have done that recently. Don't judge.) ,5,1
14,Cross-train.,Why did Rocky have to run so much when his specialty was punching people? Well; so there was plenty of inspiring footage to accompany that fantastic Rocky music... but also because great athletes know the body needs a range of workouts to stay in peak condition. If you're only doing one kind of workout (just running; just weight-training; just yoga; etc.); you may not be as fit as you think you are. You've got to mix it up if you want to be a champion like The Italian Stallion. ,"To increase overall fitness and reduce risk of injury; you should shoot for a cross-training routine that activates different muscle groups and varies cardio styles. Check out this advice from Runner's World. Be sure to keep the Rocky theme going by blasting Survivor's ""Eye of the Tiger"" while you work out; this is essential. ",10,1
15,Cut down on junk food.,According to the classic The Berenstain Bears and Too Much Junk Food; excessive consumption of chips; cookies; candy; fast food; and soda is seriously unhealthy for cartoon bears. As you likely know; science tells us that it's just as bad for humans. Studies have firmly established that a diet high in fat and calories can lead to obesity; type 2 diabetes; and heart disease. The more researchers dig into the health effects of junk food consumption; the more issues they uncover.,Choose real food instead! You're more likely to reach for junk when you're stressed or in a rush; so plan your meals in advance and organize your kitchen; your lunchbox; and your schedule to keep healthy snack options like fruits; veggies; unsalted nuts; and low-sugar granola bars within arm's reach. You may find it difficult to make the switch at first; so decide whether a gradual or cold-turkey approach is best for you.,2,1
16,Cut down on sodium.,"Sodium (a.k.a. salt; in a food context) is an insidious little devil. It's an essential electrolyte that your body needs to survive; in small portions it makes savory foods taste rich and delicious; in large portions it can produce wonderful things like cured meats or pickled fish; and it kills you. See; despite sodium's good qualities; today's diet is so overflowing with it -- used liberally as a preservative and to add flavor into the bland; cheap; processed; frozen ""food"" we eat so much of -- that we're literally overdosing. Too much sodium leads to heart disease; especially hypertension; not to mention ulcers and other badness -- it's one of the most serious problems in our diet today; ","Because of the way most of us are used to eating; cutting down sodium is really hard. The USDA recommends consuming no more than 2;300 milligrams of sodium in a day (or 1;500 if you're over 50; African-American; or have hypertension; kidney disease; or diabetes); for perspective; a single teaspoon of table salt contains 2;315 milligrams. Yes. And there's salt in almost every processed food; even in things you wouldn't expect; like cereal and milk; frozen foods and fast foods will often contain more than your entire daily requirement of salt in a single serving.  So what can you do? First and foremost; eat less processed food (the quiet source of over 75% of most people's sodium intake); choose fresh; raw food whenever possible. Pass on processed meats like sausage; lunch meat; ham; and bacon (sorry). Skip the salt in your recipes; use spices and herbs instead. Be careful with condiments; which are often laden with salt. And if you must buy processed food; look for labeled ""low-sodium"" alternatives; although that really is just the lesser of evils. Now; some people find it hard to quit salt cold turkey; because we're so used to its taste in everything; the transition can be jarring; so work your way down slowly. Every step counts. ",3,1
17,Cut spending in 2 areas.,Trimming down to a budget is harder than it looks; and if you try to do it all at once; it can wind up being like a really non-fun version of Whack-A-Mole. So start small.,Focus on two problem areas of your budget; and think about how you could cut those expenses; maybe by 10 or 20 percent. Then do it; and stick to it for a month. Once you've got that done; move on to the next two; until your budget is balanced! ,5,1
18,Discover good new music.,Are you stuck in a musical rut? You might be. Even music lovers will sometimes find themselves listening to the same albums; over and over again. And if you're still relying on commercial radio; forget about it -- you won't hear anything that hasn't been focus-grouped to death. These days you have to take initiative to find new music that really reaches you -- yet there's so much out there; more than ever; waiting to bring you incredible aesthetic and emotional experiences. Nothing elevates your soul and heightens your senses in quite the same way as good music; so; seek it out! ,There are lots of paths to new music. Blogs are a rich source; especially if there's a niche genre you're into; explore independent and college radio; or online streaming radio. The best source may be your friends -- great music is usually begging to be shared (legally; of course). Just remember; as you explore the vast world of independent & alternative music; to keep your mind open -- don't let your prejudices hold you back. ,1,1
19,Do positive work.,Everyone has a different way to do good; many of us do it by raising families; or by volunteering in our off hours. But some of us have the opportunity to do good at your jobs. This is a special kind of contribution: making it your vocation to help others is one of the greatest gifts you can give; and it often gives back tenfold in personal satisfaction (if not always in money). People who choose these careers -- teachers; caregivers; advocates and nonprofit workers; change agents of all stripes -- deserve to be celebrated; as do people who find space in their more conventional workday to give back. ,If your job has you doing good all day; then... well; congratulations! Otherwise; see what you can do at work to give back. Does your employer sponsor a charitable project you can help out with? ,15,1
20,Do yoga.,Yoga is a unique and powerful form of exercise; which has enormous health and emotional benefits; proven over millennia of practice in several religious traditions. ,The best way to get started doing yoga is by visiting a class. There are also many videos and TV programs that will introduce you. ,3,1
21,Don't stay up late.,"Because you need your beauty sleep. And by ""beauty sleep"" you mean ""the REM sleep that is necessary for your brain to work.""",Refuse the temptation to stay up. That stupid late-night talk show isn't worth it. Hit the sack! ,3,1
22,Dress well on a budget.,There's no shame in wanting to look good. We all do! But all too often; dressing well seems to come with a scary price tag. Here's a secret: you don't have to spend money to dress well. With a bit of creativity or a dogged persistence in deal-hunting; you can make a stylish statement; and still have enough money to actually go somewhere in your new clothes. ,Used; used; used! Buying gently used clothes -- even haute couture from last season -- can save you tons of money. Vintage clothing is often equally cheap; and adds an extra sense of unique flair (don't you want to be the one showing up to work in a leopard-skin pillbox hat)? (Pro tip: leopards are an endangered species. Do not wear their skin.) ,5,1
23,Drink fair trade coffee.,Fair trade coffee is a good deal for everyone -- it ensures a respectful price and good living for the people who grow it; a healthy environment for the people who live around it; and a delicious cup of coffee for you. ,Look for the Fair Trade Certified seal on the coffee you buy; or in the coffee shop you visit. ,2,1
24,Drink green tea.,Despite all the BS claims about green tea -- it is not; in fact; a magic elixir made from unicorn tears -- it can help lower cholesterol and may reduce cancer risk. Anyway it's certainly better than the creamy; sugary; brain-frying sadness juice you drink now. ,There are many kinds of green tea; and you can get it basically anywhere. It's good hot or iced. ,2,1
25,Drink orange juice.,Have you met my imaginary friend Joe? No? That's because Joe died of scurvy; the poor imaginary sap; from not getting enough imaginary Vitamin C. Avoid Joe's tragic imaginary fate by drinking a good helping of (real) delicious orange juice! ,Whether you squeeze it from the orange with your own brute force; or enjoy it from a carton/bottle -- in which case; avoid juice from concentrate; flavored drinks; or anything that isn't 100% juice -- just drink it! One of the joys of orange juice is that you don't have to fancy it up with sugar or additives: it's refreshing all on its own. ,2,1
26,Dust your home.,Let's clear one thing up first. Dust bunnies are not cute. They aren't even bunnies. Dust is piled-up balls of dead skin; dirt; hair bits; light airborne garbage particles; plant pieces; insect poop; and anything else that floats secretly through the air. Do you want to hang out with that stuff on your desk; staring at you? ,"Whether you use a fancy-schmancy HEPA air filter system; or a more traditional ""window""-based filter system; you'll need to dust your home periodically. Use a slightly damp rag or a microfiber cloth (feather dusters mostly just kick dust back up into the air; so it can resettle immediately after you leave the room); and start with high surfaces like ceiling fans and bookshelves; moving downward. (Otherwise you'll knock dust down onto things you've just cleaned!) There are lots more nuances if you're going on a serious dusting spree -- don't forget about things like lampshades (yes; you have to clean lampshades. Did we just BLOW YOUR MIND?); for one thing. See more here. ",3,1
27,Eat a complete breakfast.,"Remember all those cereal commercials that said ""part of this complete breakfast;"" showing it next to a delicious spread of eggs and toast? They weren't just saying that because it's an awesome catchphrase. They were saying that because they wanted their cereal to look like a healthy start to the day; when in fact their cereals were mostly just Sugary Flour Blobs. An actual healthy breakfast will give you (and your kids; who are in especially great need of a nutritious breakfast and especially likely to eat junk instead -- the energy you need to take on the day; without lathering on the sugar and fat. ",The primary purpose of breakfast is pull your body out of its sleepy; fasted state and get your metabolism running -- so you don't need a ton of food; just the right food. Start with dense proteins (egg whites are an excellent choice) to get your motor running; and some complex carbs to keep you from getting hungry later in the morning (stick with whole grains; like 100% whole wheat bread; you won't get much out of the refined white flour that makes up pastries and many cereals). Throw in some of the essential vitamins and minerals you need at every meal; and try to cover three of the four food groups; without adding anything loaded up with saturated fats; cholesterol; sugar; or sodium -- meaning; cut out the sausage and bacon (try turkey sausage if you're really in that traditional-breakfast mood) and replace maple syrup with sweet; fresh fruit. You can do this! ,2,1
28,Eat a vegetarian or vegan meal.,There are lots of different reasons to skip meat -- for some people it's an ethical issue; for some an environmental one; and for some it's a path to better nutrition and weight loss. (Meats can be very fatty; brim with cholesterol; and often come drenched in sodium and oil.) We prefer to focus on the fact that vegetables and grains; too often unheralded in our cuisine; can be absolutely delicious in a way that meat just can't imitate. If you haven't tried a well-prepared vegetarian meal; you're missing out on some sublime culinary experiences. ,The primary challenge in healthy vegetarian eating is getting enough protein. Make liberal use of dairy (if it's part of your diet); tofu; beans; grains (try quinoa where you might otherwise use pasta) and nuts (watch out for their fat content; though); and pile on vegetables like peas and spinach. (Don't focus on just one protein: your body metabolizes them in varying ways; so it's important to have a variety). Beyond that; if you're used to the fatty richness of meat; its absence can be jarring; cook your vegetables creatively (we endorse roasting as a simple way to make just about any veggie delicious) and experiment freely to find recipes that satisfy your palate. ,3,1
29,Eat fruit or vegetables.,"Fruit and vegetables not only boast bright colors and amusing names like ""arugula"" and ""kumquat;"" they also contain the vitamins; minerals; and fiber that your body needs to fight disease and stay balanced. And almost nobody gets enough. The MyPlate guide actually says that half of every meal should be fruit and vegetables. Half. How do you like them apples? (...See what we did there? ""Apples""? Never mind.) ",Go eat some fruit and/or vegetables. Feel free to arrange them in an attractive or amusing way; just be sure you eat them afterwards. (Pro tip: dried or highly processed fruits are not going to be so useful to you. Focus on the fresh or frozen.) ,2,1
30,Eat healthy with the family.,Help your children develop balanced eating habits by following your example. A family that eats together; celebrating the experience of a family meal; builds positive behaviors that your kids will retain for life.,This doesn't need to be a formal !familydinner. Eating together is as simple as grabbing a delicious !completebreakfast before school; or sharing a snack in the afternoon. The key is to lead by example: if your kids see that you're trying a variety of new foods; they'll be more comfortable trying it too (especially if they can have a bit of yours first).,2,1
31,Eat leafy greens.,"Have you ever heard of Vitamin K? The K stands for ""Kick-ass"". Vitamin K is the reserved; secretive little vitamin that regulates blood clotting; help keeps your bones firm; and may prevent diabetes; arthritis; and inflammation; plus; because it's fat-soluble; foods with Vitamin K are actually healthier if you eat them with oil or dressing. WHAT?!?! Yeah. Anyway; Vitamin K is one of dozens of such nutrients that are all up in leafy green vegetables; such as spinach; cabbage kale; arugula; Swiss chard; collard greens; mustard greens; and even the greens that stick out of vegetables like turnips and beets. These guys are loaded with fiber; beta carotene; an entire alphabet of vitamins; calcium; antioxidants; and all with a bare minimum of calories and carbs. They are the A-Team of vegetables; and they rank among the healthiest things you can ever eat. (Our primitive ancestors ate leaves basically nonstop -- some projections say they would eat an entire grocery bag's worth of leafy vegetables every day.) ",Conveniently; leafy greens don't have legs and generally aren't sentient; so you don't have to chase or wrestle them in order to subdue them. You can just pick up as many leafy vegetables as you want; out of your garden (pro tip: swiss chard) or at the grocery store - here's a good list for reference. To eat them; a salad is the obvious choice; especially if they're fresh (try a local farmer's market to get them at their peak - the difference can be astounding); it can be startling at first to adjust to the intense flavor of leafy greens if you're used to more boring vegetables like lettuce; but within a few days you'll never want to go back. You can also saut??e just about any leafy greens: drop those bad boys in a pan with some oil and garl,3,1
32,Eat lean meat.,If you want to cut down on your intake of fat and cholesterol; you should probably -- well; you should probably avoid meat entirely. But a vegetarian diet is a radical change for a lot of people; and for some it just isn't nutritionally or culturally realistic; the next best option is to choose hearty; protein-rich; lean meat. ,"I've got two words for you: ""SEA"" and ""FOOD."" Fish and seafood are lean; light; and wonderfully flavorful (if you're lucky enough to get them fresh; that is -- don't trifle with frozen or processed 'fish' products; or anything that strikes you as; uh; ""fishy."" Subprime seafoods pose a serious toxicity risk). Our landlocked; pregnant; or finicky friends might do better with poultry (favor breasts and white meats to reduce fat intake; and for heaven's sake don't eat the skin); or -- wait for it -- wild game; which is usually much leaner than farm-raised meat.      If you are indulging in red meat -- and DailyFeats won't begrudge you an occasional steak or stack of shortribs (we're all human) -- try to make leaner choices; like 90%+ lean ground beef (have you tried ground bison as a substitute) or anything labeled ""extra lean;"" and cut off or drain fat whenever possible when cooking. The American Heart Association has an excellent; throrough guide to your options. ",2,1
33,Eat leftovers.,Every time you throw food away; a little baby plant cries. So does your wallet. About 40% of all food in America is wasted; and it collectively costs us over $1 billion -- with a B -- just to dispose of it; never mind growing; shipping; processing; preserving; and cooking it in the first place. Does all that really have to happen just because you don't want reheated pasta? ,"Some foods; like pizza; make this easy. (Pro tip: reheat pizza on a nonstick griddle at very low heat; to get a crispy crust and warm; melty cheese.) Other times it's as simple as packing up a lunch in a sturdy bag or plastic container. But if you've got; for example; leftover meat stuck to a congealed roast chicken; you might be tempted to throw it away. Don't be: whether you take a shortcut to make it appetizing; such as dumping cheese and hot sauce on it; and nuking the hell out of it (in culinary circles this is known as ""the Fratboy Special""); or search for a recipe that will make use of sundry materials -- try a site like Supercook that generates recipes based on the ingredients you have handy -- a little commitment to leftovers goes a long way. ",2,1
34,Eat less fat.,Fat's not evil -- our bodies need a certain amount of it to function -- but too much of it causes problems. And the way we eat; these days; almost everybody gets too much of it. Choosing low-fat or nonfat foods can make a big difference in helping you achieve a balanced diet. ,"Don't be fooled by ""low-fat"" versions of crappy processed foods. If they have to take fat out of something; it shouldn't be something you eat in the first place; and it will probably taste like wood chips anyway. Instead; choose meals that don't have a lot of fat: emphasize lean meat (if you eat meat at all) and always remove the skin; minimize your use of oils; creams; mayonnaise; and butter; and for heaven's sake don't fry things (choose baked; boiled; broiled; and steamed foods instead). ",3,1
35,Eat less sugar.,You're sweet enough already. (Awwwww.) But listen: it's no secret that excessive consumption of sugar has been adding inches to America's waistlines and cavities to its mouths for the past several decades. As if that weren't bad enough; research also suggests that eating too much sugar might damage your heart; too. ,If you drink soda or other sugary drinks daily; you need to roundhouse kick that habit. Replace your usual beverage with water; which is not only good for you; it also doesn't slowly kill you. Make sure to read food nutrition facts to trim other unnecessary sugar. It can hide in unexpected places: did you know that some brands of jarred spaghetti sauce have as much sugar per serving as a Pop Tart? Check out this list of hidden sugar sources; and start shopping smarter. ,3,1
36,Eat locally grown food.,Unless you're a really big fan of the Asian cargo-ship industry; it's better to buy your food from local producers. Local food isn't just fresher and likely more natural -- it also supports your local economy and bolsters family farms; which badly need your help. ,Lots of supermarkets; especially food co-ops; are now highlighting local food. Better yet; find a farmers' market; farm stand; or farm share near you! ,2,1
37,Eat natural food.,They say ??you are what you eat?? -- well; when you were a kid; did you say ??When I grow up I want to be disodium guanylate and added artificial flavorings??? No; you did not. ,A lot of products claim to be ??natural;?? ??organic;?? etc. You can't always trust them. Research what you buy; and see how clear brands and restaurants are about what's in their food and where it comes from -- the more detail you can find; the more confident you can be that you're eating real food! ,2,1
38,Embrace your potential.,Because being realistic doesn't mean giving up. Too many of us assume that our lives' potentials are limited by the circumstances around us; and that the idea of chasing a dream belongs in books and children's movies; that just isn't true. If you study the world objectively you'll see that opportunity is everywhere; and that with motivation and perseverance you can accomplish things that seem utterly impossible right now. The laws of physics dictate that energy never disappears; it only changes form; if you put your energy into your dreams; even if that dream seems awfully far away; by definition that energy is going somewhere; and you are therefore on your way to achieving your goals.,"The key to this feat is resolve. Working toward your potential can be a long; trying; and discouraging experience; and if you don't start off on the right foot you're not very likely to succeed. So make a resolution -- and not a lightweight; vague one like ""I'm going to be super cool;"" but rather a concrete one that you can build plans for; like ""I'm going to learn graphic design"" or ""I'm going to run a marathon."" Once you've done that; you can start planning; and your potential will start looking very real indeed. ",10,1
39,Enjoy your relationship.,Sure; there's lots of work involved in a relationship -- whether it's your first week of dating or your fortieth year of marriage. But one of the best ways to keep each other happy and satisfied is to... well... keep each other happy and satisfied. After all; every couple should spend some time enjoying life's great pleasures; and they should feel free to get excited about it; unleashing your passion helps keep your relationship joyful and lively. ,Obviously; we're talking here about organized card tournaments; such as bridge; canasta; or pinochle competitions. Other table games; like bingo or mahjongg; are also fun ways to put some spice into your relationship. / If you're not of the card-game persuasion -- and why not; might we ask -- there are all kinds of places for you to find your passion. Whether it's in art; music; food; dancing; hiking; rock-climbing; paintball; beatboxing; antiquing; competitive bowling; Civil War reenactment... we are rambling. Point being; find something that makes you happy; and pour your heart and soul in it. /What; you thought we meant something else? Why would you think that? ,5,1
40,Express love.,Being told 'I love you' can be a marvelous; dramatic; swelling-orchestral-soundtrack moment in your life -- but it can also be a daily; constant reminder of the relationships your life is founded on. Both of these are pretty excellent things. ,This is best when it's organic -- let it slip out over dinner; when you're hanging up the phone; or just at random during a silent moment. You don't need to make a big deal out of it. ,2,1
41,Fix something yourself.,Professional service and repair is expensive. Like; first-born expensive. You can save a LOT of money just by learning to do some very basic household tasks. And it's always better to be able to take care of things around the house; instead of sitting around in a cold/flooded/drafty house waiting for your landlord or a contractor to come around. ,It's important not to bite off more than you can chew. Don't go messing around with your heating; plumbing; or electricity (for example) without some experience and expertise; you could very easily break something; or worse; hurt yourself. Instead start with little things -- a finicky toilet flush here; a squeaky door hinge there -- and work your way up. Use every resource available to you; from users' manuals and online guides (check for good sources if you go this route) to friendly neighbors and of course common sense. Take opportunities to learn when they come around: try changing your own oil one day; or help out a friend with a home renovation project. Eventually you'll be ready to handle a once-daunting maintenance challenge without blinking an eye! ,5,1
42,Get a good night's sleep.,When you don't get the rest you need; you start to look like a zombie. Nobody likes zombies; people tend to run away from them; screaming. That can sometimes hold back the unfortunate zombie-resembling people's attempts to socialize. Beyond not looking like a zombie; researchers have uncovered many benefits of healthy sleep patterns: people who get enough quality sleep at night enjoy greater memory; physical performance; creativity; and longevity. They also tend to have lower stress and body weight. And; most importantly for those of us who share our beds; they're usually not as crabby or zombie-like in the mornings. ,7-8 undisturbed hours per night is widely considered the best target for adults. To get there; connect with some counting sheep. If that doesn't work; try these tips -- for starters; say no to late afternoon caffeine fixes; and avoid using your computer or smartphone for an hour before you hit the sack. ,3,1
43,Get a health screening.,Everybody likes to get checked out by an attractive stranger from time to time--so why not get checked out by a doctor? Periodic screening for a range of common health issues is a hugely important part of preventative medicine. In short: screening helps your doctor catch small problems before they become big; scary; expensive ones. Depending on your age and gender; you may need occasional mammograms; prostrate exams; depression screenings; vision and hearing exams; STD testing; etc. Most screenings are relatively quick and painless. ,If you consistently visit a primary care physician; you're probably already being screened; but talk to your doctor to make sure that's the case. Don't forget to raise any specific concerns you may have based on your personal and family medical history. ,15,1
44,Get active with the family.,Families are stronger together -- and active playtime is one of your greatest opportunities to build that strength. By getting active together; you're teaching your kids that an active; healthy lifestyle can be fun -- not to mention building their confidence; teamwork and self-esteem. (Doesn't hurt to get yourself off the couch; either.),Just get up; and get going! This doesn't have to be long or structured: throwing a ball around; racing around the yard; even just a walk to explore nature or the neighborhood. Activity adds up over time; and the more you do it; the easier and more natural it'll get. ,10,1
45,Get sunlight safely (with sunscreen).,Sunlight provides Vitamin D; which keeps your bones from suddenly turning to mush; and it can help improve your mood. Also sunbathing is more fun than work. ,Use some decent sunscreen (at least 30 SPF); then just find a place to soak up the sun! Parks and riverbanks are nice. If you get bored easily; bring a book or music. ,1,1
46,Get your vitamins.,"Take a page out of the great lyricist Popeye's book: ""I'm strong to the finich 'cause I eats my spinach."" America's favorite sailor man used the powerful vitamins and minerals in a can of spinach to beat the bad guy and get the girl every time! So impress the Olive Oyl in your life by eating a diet rich in the nutrients your body needs. Vitamin deficiency can cause a whole host of nasty symptoms like anemia; bone weakness; and fatigue; ensuring that you get your Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of essential vitamins and minerals keeps your body at its best today; and protects your future health. ","Most people can get the vitamins they need from regularly eating a diverse range of fruits; vegetables; lean proteins; and whole grains. Hey; DailyFeats; what about all those vitamin and multivitamin supplements? The Harvard School of Public Health calls vitamin supplements a ""good insurance policy"" for people concerned about their vitamin intake; but studies have suggested that your body is much better at processing vitamins found naturally in healthy foods. Don't rely on pills when real food is available. ",2,1
47,Go above and beyond at work.,"According to recent research; Americans are the most overworked people in the developed world. So extra responsibilities might seem like the last thing you need; but offering to lend a hand shows your co-workers you care. After all; you can't succeed if the team doesn't. For a little inspiration; revisit what you learned from Reading Rainbow: ""TEAM WORK. You got a dream; you want to make it real; you need a team; working up steam to make your DREAM WORK."" Yes: dream work. ",Become the invisible elf who refills the printer paper and the coffeepot. Volunteer to support co-workers with a lot on their plates. If you have the time; tackle a project to improve your work environment. ,5,1
48,Go camping.,The campfire! Long recognized as a symbol of rugged survivalism; a provider of warmth; and a melter of marshmallows; today's campfire is the centerpiece of that great American adventure we call camping. Spend some quality time with it. ,Everyone camps a little differently; depending on your experience level and where you are; for example; some confused souls camp indoors. (This is usually less satisfying.) the important thing is that you plan ahead; making sure to bring plenty of supplies and food; so that once you're there you're not uncomfortable; worried; or forced to scavenge neighboring campsites and fight bears for scraps. (Bear fights usually end; in our experience; with a delicious dinner for the bear.) ,25,1
49,Go hiking.,Hiking is exercise in its purest form: the same way our ancestors got around; tens of thousands of years ago. Except with more trail mix and jackets; and less shamanic medicine and mastodon fights. But; you know; details. ,Make sure you prepare well; and choose a trail near you that looks like it's your style. ,25,1
50,Go running.,Our bodies were built to run. You don't need to be an endurance runner or a tribal game hunter to use your natural running ability!,Lace up some running shoes and just run somewhere. The rest is pretty much up to you. ,10,1
51,Go swimming.,You can drop your body into a huge pool of water; and more or less; it floats. Doesn't that kind of blow your mind? Also; you know; exercise is good. ,Presuming you've had swimming lessons; just head for your local pool or beach.,5,1
52,Go to your college class.,Yes; we know. Your bed is comfortable. And it's cold outside. And your lecture is on the other side of campus. And you're pretty sure you can get the notes online or from your friend Steve anyway. And Maury Povich is about to come on; and you freaking love Maury Povich. And you forgot to shower; and this stuff probably isn't going to be on the exam; and you can't find your lucky pencil; etc. TOO BAD. Sack up and go to class. Skipping lectures in college is stupid; it's a waste of an opportunity and a waste of time. ,You know how to do this. You did it freshman week; before you turned into the horrible slacker you've become; and you still do it for that one 9am stats class that put the fear of God into you. So do it for the rest of them! If you're really struggling with making it to class; here is some helpful advice. ,2,1
53,Have a date night.,Whether you're in the infatuated first stages of a relationship; or going into your 50th year of domestic bliss; a relationship still needs that time -- a night; even just a couple of hours; for you and your partner to just be together; enjoying each other's company. Without it; even the most devoted couples can start to drift. ,It's hard to go wrong with a nice dinner (although they can get pricey); feel free to get more creative. Where did you and your partner meet? Is there a romantic spot on the edge of town you always wanted to go? Tonight's the night! ,5,1
54,Have a healthy snack.,Because an unhealthy snack would be; uh... unhealthy. (DailyFeats: proudly serving tautologies since 2011.) And snacking; in and of itself; is important -- eating lots of small; nutritious meals throughout the day is better for your metabolism and prevents gorging at mealtime. ,This is the challenging part. Plan your snacks around these key elements:   Calories. Unless you're an athlete or a bodybuilder; you don't need more than 200 calories in your snack; probably even 100. You just don't.      Long-term satisfaction. Emphasize foods with soluble fiber and low glycemic load; so the nutrients hit your bloodstream slowly and create a lasting feeling of fullness.    Nutrition. Your snack shouldn't be empty calories: get the protein; complex carbs; and vitamins you need to sustain yourself.      So what makes a good snack? Try fresh fruit and vegetables; whole grain breads or crackers; yogurt; or trail mix/nuts); and always keep your portion small. Here are some more suggestions!,2,1
55,Have a picnic.,Back in the day; picnics were a classic American tradition; between increasing suburbanization and our dependence on processed food; though; they've started to vanish from our emotional landscape. That's a shame; because picnics are a simple and enjoyable way to spend quality time with your family and enjoy the outdoors at the same time. Bring this old standby back! ,You'll need some people; a big blanket; napkins. food -- sandwiches are an easy choice; as are cold salads (pack with ice to prevent spoilage) or leftovers; and make sure to bring lots of fresh fruit and vegetables -- and a good spot; usually in a public park (make sure that food is permitted) or; in a pinch; your or a family member's backyard. Once you're there; sit and enjoy! Always clean up after yourself: it's rude to leave junk lying around in nature. ,15,1
56,Have dinner with your family.,It's well-documented that eating in front of the television; on the road; at your desk; or wherever else; leads to overeating. But it's also just less fun! Family dinners are a beloved tradition in a lot of families; and for good reason: they're a chance to reflect on the day; talk about what matters you to; and enjoy time together without distractions. Even if that time leads to arguments and awkwardness sometimes -- which; in many families; it inevitably will -- it's better than eating alone. ,Can you eat? Can you sit? Can you do both at once; without looking at your cellphone or a television? Good -- you're done. Everything else is irrelevant. ,5,1
57,Have fun with your family.,Is your family big? Small? Close-knit or extended? Imaginary? Doesn't matter. You can still enjoy time together; which is what family is all about.,As we all know; the best way to do this is to rent a bus or large RV; travel with your family to a large open meadow; and start an impromptu music festival featuring violin jam sessions and handmade artisanal corn dogs. But if for some reason this option is not available to you; we recommend a simpler approach: get your family together and visit the park; set up a game; or just put some children (preferably yours) in a room and see what happens. Usually; given the right conditions; fun emerges. ,3,1
58,Have grandparent-grandkid time.,Grandparents are families' secret weapons. Most of the time they lurk in the background; watching NCIS; forwarding you emails that have clip art drawings of teddy bears in them; and puttering around town at 25mph making jerks in sports cars hurl their cellphones at them in rage. But one day; out of the blue; BAM: there the grandparents are; looking after your kids; providing valuable guidance borne of wisdom and experience; and building an irreplaceable connection to your family's heritage. Didn't see that coming; did you? They're like ninjas. ,If you're lucky enough to have one or more grandparent around -- and remember; not everyone is -- call them up! Retired or not; they'd probably love to spend some time with you; no need for a special occasion or a fancy family get-together. Break out a board game; cook a meal together; go out for a walk; or just hang out -- trust us; even if their senior-citizen habits grind your gears a little; it's worth it. / Now; if you are a grandparent: isn't that Mark Harmon just great on NCIS? Also; when was the last time you called up your grandkids' house? No sense sitting by the phone waiting for them to call you -- kids these days rarely think to communicate by phone. ,5,1
59,Have hope.,No matter our circumstances; we can always have hope. It's the belief -- the resolve -- that the future will be better than the present. Living with hope energizes; motivates; and compels us to live well. It brings purpose. And if nothing else; it brings a smile and a bit of calm in a life that can be otherwise quite unpredictable. ,Many people draw hope from their faith; others from history and philosophy; others from family; friends; and the joyful moments that quietly fill our lives. No matter what inspires you to see positive change in the world; just focus on it; and use it as a reminder for you when things get difficult. ,1,1
60,Have perspective.,We get hung up on small obstacles. Everybody does it. When you're stuck in traffic; or fumbling with a screwdriver; or trying to convince your four-year-old to just eat the freaking broccoli; little things in life can make us furious. Luckily there's a simple solution to this problem: thinking about the big picture; the context of our lives and world; can make these trivial problems seem -- well -- trivial. ,For some of us it's as simple as stopping; when we're at the point of frustration; and thinking about why we're really here: family; love; faith; passion; purpose. Other times; we really benefit from an outside reality check: how would your grandparents; for example; have reacted to this situation? What about one of your role models? Seeing a situation through someone else's eyes can completely reorient our opinions about it. ,1,1
61,Hit a personal best.,Some of the greatest moments in our lives are when we're shown a barrier -- a line that it seems like we can't cross -- and one day; bam; we break through it. Hitting a personal best is one of those moments. It's awesome. And a dedicated practice regimen; in athletics or in any part of life; can get you there regularly.,A great coach once told us that when you compete with yourself; you always win. Pushing yourself; training yourself; finding hidden strengths; and striving to improve your performance bit-by-bit -- that's what makes a champion; whether you're an athlete; an artist; a businessperson; a parent; or anybody who's got a big job to tackle.,15,1
62,Hug someone.,Hugs are wonderful! We could go into lots of detail here about the positive psychological and social effects of hugs; but basically; hugs are just really awesome for everyone involved. Yay; hugs! ,First; ensure that your prospective hugging partner is in fact a consensual participant in the hug; and not; say; a random stranger on the street; or an angry squirrel; or a lamppost. Once in a mutually agreed-upon hugging scenario; though; you have some options. DailyFeats recommends:  - the Full Speed Run Towards Each Other With Potentially Painful Impact Hug;  - the Actually Lift The Other Person Off the Ground To Their Slight Concern Hug; - the Awkward Manly Just-The-Shoulders Hug; - the Unexpected Bonus Kiss On The Cheek Hug;  - or the Classic Warm Embrace That No One Knows When To End Hug. If you're not clear how one or more of these particular hugs can be executed; consult your local hugging consultant. ,2,1
63,Ignore digital distractions.,Electronics (read: robots) are taking over the world fast enough -- unplug your gadgets to delay the inevitable just a little bit longer. OK; robot hordes may not be poised to wrest control of the planet Earth from our fragile human grasp just yet; but a growing need to stare at glowing screens is hurting our real-life relationships. When was the last time you hung out alone without checking your computer or phone obsessively? Do you tend to focus more on texts and e-mails than you do on the people right in front of you? That is; uh; bad. ,Maybe easier said than done: just turn off all those tempting; blinking devices. From there; do what it takes to reconnect with reality. Have a (gasp!) face-to-face conversation; take a long walk; read a (paper) book; or start that creative project you've been putting off. ,2,1
64,Insulate your home.,Stuck wearing one of these last winter? Insulating your home can keep you snug without The Snuggie. Plus; the EPA estimates that savvy homeowners who properly insulate can save up to 20% on their annual heating and cooling costs.,First; figure out what types of insulation your home already has. Then; check out this US Department of Energy guide and get to work!,25,1
65,Invent something.,Thomas Edison -- you know; the guy who invented basically everything we use; including electric lights and the iPod -- started out as a newspaper salesman on a railroad in rural Michigan. He spent a lot of time messing around with telegraph machines; reading; and making stuff. In his life Edison invented over a thousand things; many of which were kind of ridiculous. Couldn't you do that? ,Once you have an idea; there are lots of steps involved in patenting; prototyping; and even selling your invention. But first; you need an idea. Think about your daily life; what have you done lately that could have been easier? More efficient? More fun? What technologies do you use that you could improve; modify; or combine? What do you like to play with? Any of these questions can lead you to the space that your new invention could fill... ,50,1
66,Investigate your beliefs.,"Aristotle said ""the unexamined life is not worth living;"" and this is coming from a guy who spent his entire life walking around in a toga and talking about stuff; so you know he was on to something. Critically examining how you think about the world -- from things like logic and mathematics all the way up to morals; ethics; and your personal approach to life -- is an essential part of being a mature; intellectually competent person. If you don't understand on some level how you choose to process information; how can you trust the decisions you make? How can you call yourself conscious? Without self-reflection; are you really that different from; say; a toaster? ",Unfortunately; this one is really hard. And we're not even talking about studying academic philosophy or reading the classics; just thinking for yourself; laying out your beliefs and your assumptions; is surprisingly challenging in practice. So tackle this feat however makes sense for you. It's worth doing some introductory reading about philosophy (we're partial to the sort-of-novel Sophie's World; by Jostein Gaarder; but there are lots of more straightforward introductions available at your local bookstore); or maybe introductory listening. Alternatively; dive right in -- one fun way to put your ideas to the test is by trying a quiz; such as this academic study or this more amusing test. Share your thoughts; questions; and conclusions when you check in! ,2,1
67,Keep a food journal.,You might think you're a healthy eater. But could you prove it in court? (There is a Food Court joke in here somewhere; but we have more important matters to discuss.) We're all in denial to some degree about what; and how much; we eat; it's easy to remember that one time you picked yogurt instead of a candy bar; and even easier to conveniently forget about that same morning; when you happily ordered a 780-calorie Cheesy Deluxey McGreasy Biscuit Thing for breakfast. Without the cold; hard facts staring us in the face; we're never quite honest about what we eat; and we can't make objective decisions about how to improve it. ,There are plenty of apps and websites for this -- we don't really endorse any of them; but they're easy enough to find on your own and they all seem pretty good; especially if you're into calorie counting. Still there's something to be said for just a pencil and a notepad; write down every meal (right away -- don't put it off) and the context in which you ate it; and at the end of the day look it over and ask yourself; did you make good choices today? Where and when are you cheating; and what can you do about it? ,2,1
68,Keep your pet(s) safe.,Part of your responsibility to your furry (or feathery; or scaly) friends is to keep them safe -- from the dangers outside; but also in your own home.,There are several important ways to keep your pet safe: - Safe from loss. No housepet is equipped to survive in the wild; and they should never have to. Keep indoor pets safely inside; and always have your dogs and cats microchipped; so that hopefully if they do get lost they'll be recovered. - Safe from toxins. Some chemicals; plants; and even foods that are perfectly safe for humans can be very harmful for pets. Don't feed your pets people food (that's never good for their nutrition; anyway); keep medication and cleaning products well-secured in high places; and watch out for seemingly innocuous plants like lilies and poinsettias. -  Safe in emergencies. Make a good disaster plan that includes planning for your pets' shelter; food; and transportation needs if you're evacuated. And don't ever leave your pet outside or chained during a storm; if you're staying inside for safety; so should they.,15,1
69,Learn about Earth.,Of all the fields of science; Earth science - the study of our planet; its land; water; air; and life - is arguably the most relevant to our daily lives. Most of us live on Earth; after all. And the more you know about our planet; the better you can take care of it! In the fight to protect species; knowledge is your most powerful tool; the more you learn; the more information you can share with others. ,Our partners at World Wildlife Fund have done some cool stuff with ecoregions: large areas of natural communities that share common species and environmental conditions. By learning more about the three types of ecoregions -- terrestrial; marine; and freshwater -- you can equip yourself to better protect these regions; and ensure a healthy future for our planet. Alternatively; pick any scientific topic that interests you - try starting with plate tectonics; which are pretty cool; or the reversal of the magnetic poles if you really want to blow your mind - and just surf the Internet. Sites from educational institutions or government agencies are often the best. ,3,1
70,Learn an old family story.,Life was more interesting in the past. Odds are that someone in your family; whether they lived fifty years ago or five hundred; has done or witnessed something seriously awesome. Learning these stories - even if; as usually happens; they get exaggerated over time - is a great way to learn about yourself and connect with your roots.,Elderly relatives usually love nothing so much as to tell long; detailed stories about the past. This may or may not be worth your time; depending on the relative. Consider research instead; if you know your ancestors' names and hometowns; a look at Google Books might yield something interesting. ,10,1
71,Learn new skills.,Although it's true that you can't teach old dogs new tricks; you personally are probably not a dog. (If you are a dog; please disregard this.) Learning new abilities is an essential part of growing as a person; not to mention becoming a better candidate in case you need to look for work; it keeps your mind sharp and opens new opportunities for accomplishment. ,Monster's got some tips for how to learn new skills; and to make them count for your career. ,10,1
72,Look for a job.,Jobs don't look for you. (This is not Soviet Russia.) Finding work is a long and often difficult process; requiring a serious investment of time and a Sisyphean level of persistence -- especially if the job market is finally waking up again. But you can't give up -- whether you're unemployed; underemployed; or just looking for a change; only by seeking will you find the work you deserve. ,Both through networking and through online job searching (may we suggest our partner; Monster.com?); get your name out there! Look for job opportunities that excite you; research them; write finely crafted cover letters and include a killer resume -- then follow up; follow up; and follow up; until you get your foot in the door. You can succeed by taking things one step at a time; and by making sure every part of your job search is well-thought-out. Remember; the Internet is here to help. ,5,1
73,Make it through Monday.,"As the Boomtown Rats -- truly the poetic voice of their generation -- eloquently sang; ""I don't like Mondays."" No one likes Mondays. But you don't have to accept the dread; loathing; and misery that comes with returning to the daily grind. Keep your eyes on the prize and just survive. ",This is all about attitude. Don't think about Monday as the first fifth of the week -- think about it as the week's hardest day. That way; once you've made it through Monday; everything else is cake! (Not literal cake. Unless you work in a bakery; in which case you should find a different analogy. Also; can we have some cake?) ,3,1
74,Make Mom smile!,Moms matter. They guide and inspire us in ways we often don't even realize. Don't they deserve a little something in return? Anything you can do for Mom; to show her how much she means to you or just to brighten her day; is a good start.,That's up to you! Whether it's a simple phone call or a deeply meaningful gift -- have you thought about; for example; a day at the spa? -- there's something that will make her grin from ear to ear. Even your check-in of this feat might be enough: tell us about your mother; grandmother; sister; best friend; or any mom you know and love. Share a story that is passionate and thoughtful -- just like Mom. She might just win a prize from 1-800-FLOWERS! ,5,1
75,Make sure you're being paid fairly.,Are you earning as much as you're worth? How do you know? In a free market; it's your job to make sure you're being paid fairly -- that your salary is keeping pace with your peers and with inflation. A little research will answer that question. ,Use a salary comparison website to compare your pay with the average earnings of people in your job; preferably with your level of education and experience. If you find that you're being underpaid; don't be afraid to simply ask for a raise; and use the statistics you found to back up your argument. ,5,1
76,Make the bed.,"You know that wonderful feeling of climbing into neat; tucked-in sheets? Believe it or not; some technological pioneers get that feeling every night; using a rare and obscure innovation once thought lost to the older generations. It's called ""making the bed;"" and now you can do it too! ",Here are step-by-step instructions if you need them; but for many of us the big challenge is doing this regularly. Don't wait until nighttime; when you'll likely be sleepy enough to just climb into a messy bed and reinforce that bad habit; take 2 or 3 minutes in your morning routine to fold those sheets. It'll make your house look cleaner; and if you have pets who like to sleep on the bed; it's a nice courtesy to them. ,2,1
77,Meditate.,We spend so much of our time running around; constantly watching three things at once; stressing out. Meditation helps you put away those distractions and relax your body and mind. ,Shut off the TV and computer; put away the phone; sit down; and relax. Try to clear your mind. Here are some more detailed tips.,5,1
78,Participate in a study group.,When it comes to studying; the buddy system really is best. You retain information more effectively when called upon to explain it to others -- study groups are a great opportunity to play teacher to friends as you learn. Unless you're Kim Jong-Il; you can probably also see the general benefits of idea exchange. ,Reach out to classmates well in advance of the exam you need to study for. You may find that study groups already exist in your class; or you could volunteer to coordinate e-mails and start one. Just don't ask to be referred to as Dear Study Group Leader. ,10,1
79,Pay your debt.,Reducing your debt is like feeding a wild boar. (Go with us on this one.) At the beginning; you can toss it just about any chunk of food you can find; and the boar will still seem ravenously hungry; glaring at you with the fury that only a boar can truly convey. (Boars are omnivores who eat just about anything.) You'll be tempted to run away and leave the boar to terrorize all the other villagers. But piece by piece; the boar grows fatter and more content; and soon the threat to you and the village has passed; eventually; after the eighteenth spponful of leftover taco meat; the boar lies down and goes to sleep. That's exactly how debt reduction works. ,You will need a very long spoon and some protective gloves debt repayment plan. Try paying over the minimum if you can afford it; but even the minimum is nothing to sneeze at. Consider automating your payments as well; to ensure you make that minimum every month. If you've got several loans; it might be to your advantage to look into debt consolidation; and always think about changing your payment plan if you have a change in your financial situation.,10,1
80,Plan ahead.,"As the ancient proverb goes; ""A man without a plan is like a naked mole rat in a blizzard."" OK; we made that up. Point is: if you don't have a plan; you're basically blind; nude; and at the mercy of the elements. ",If an important event or decision is on the horizon; take enough time to research and prepare. Also; make sure you have savings and strategies to help you deal with situations that could arise without warning. Start small with scheduling recurring bill payments through the end of the year; or designing an emergency escape plan for your home. ,5,1
81,Plan your meals.,One of the biggest obstacles to healthy eating is that you have to cook. No matter how many groceries you stock up on; when 6 PM rolls around after a tiring workday; it's all too common to run into one of three problems:     1. You've got all kinds of food in your fridge and absolutely no clue what to do with it;     2. You've got an awesome recipe in mind and none of the ingredients you need;     3. You're way too tired even to figure out what you could possibly cook. /All of these wind up putting you on the next train to Takeoutville; with stops along the way at Greasytown and Heartattackburg. You can solve them by planning ahead: setting up for a few days' worth (or even a full week) of meals; buying your groceries and setting your recipes in advance; removes all those barriers to healthy and responsible meals. You can come home from work; pick up your plan; and just get cooking. ,The big challenge here is getting recipe ideas. The Internet is full of them; of course; but it can be overwhelming to choose (especially since a lot are of questionable quality or nutrition). If you're going to plan lots of meals at home; it's easier to just invest in a good cookbook (or two; or three) so you can easily flip through; pick recipes you like; and head right for the grocery store. Cookbooks with calorie counts are especially useful.      As for what you choose; it's up to you: always be realistic with time (don't plan a three-hour roast when you and your spouse are working late) and balance new; creative ideas with simple and easy favorites. If you'd like a more detailed model to follow; The Simple Mom and The Simple Dollar both have great and easy-to-follow instructions. ,10,1
82,Play a musical instrument. ,Music is good for your soul -- but making music is good for your mind too. If you play a musical instrument regularly; you build focus; coordination; and confidence; keeping your cognition and emotions sharp. Not coincidentally; you also get better at making music; thereby increasing the odds that your energetic piano performance will be a big hit at an old-timey 1920s house party. ,You may have been lucky enough to take lessons; as a kid or an adult; in which case the importance of making practice a regular habit has probably been drilled deep into your bones. If not -- well; consider taking some lessons! Musical instruments are hard to just pick up (excepting the harmonica and the tambourine; although even they have their nuances); and learning from another musician is usually a much more effective and fun way to build skills and explore music. ,5,1
83,Practice martial arts.,What do Chuck Norris and Bruce Lee have in common? Well; two things. One; they could squish you like a small insect. Two; they are fit. Martial arts like karate; judo; fencing; boxing; and the like are an exceedingly powerful form of full-body exercise: they build strength; flexibility; endurance; and discipline. You don't have to be a black belt to feel the positive effects of even a few martial-arts sessions on your body and mind. ,"Many gyms offer basic martial arts sessions; but you'll get a more in-depth experience at a dedicated studio. Sticking to your training regimen is important: these disciplines require patience and dedication; and you won't get anywhere if you don't commit. That's why it's best to have a dedicated sensei who will guide you through the learning process; and also give you a charming nickname; such as ""little bog-serpent."" ",15,1
84,Prioritize.,Managing a workload is a serious challenge for which most of us are woefully untrained. The traditional model; in which a manager assigns tasks and monitors progress; is increasingly disappearing -- today many employees (of all industries and skill levels) are expected to accomplish goals based on their own planning and strategy. One of the keys to doing this well is prioritizing: figuring out which tasks are essential to reach a target; and which can wait or be safely ignored. (And the same process applies to managing the chores and tasks that fill your personal life; btw.) So; you know; do that! ,"Most people have their own idiosyncratic ways to do this -- here's one approach to get you thinking -- but most of them involve some combination of organizing your tasks; putting them in a list; and then dividing them up based on importance and time. Try planning out your week with priorities for each day. The secret is sticking to it: work has a bad habit of turning small things into big crises; and incoming emails often scream ""READ ME!!! I'M IMPORTANT!!!""; which can ruin your priority planning if you're not careful. ",3,1
85,Push for justice as a student.,"Just because you're young doesn't mean that your voice doesn't count. Now; this might seem obvious to you: ""Of course my voice counts! I'm a person too; and I believe in this; and that; and the other thing..."" which is all well and good. BUT: if you don't act on it; if you don't put your beliefs into practice; you and your whole generation might as well be silent and let the older folks run the show. You've got to put your money -- well; you're a young person; so probably not your money; but your ENERGY -- where your mouth is.","All great movements started with a few people and a vision. So whether the cause that motivates you is a big; established one with thousands of supporters; or a new idea that might get you laughed at; your task is the same: work for it; with dedication. Get a group of friends together and start communicating with others; use the Internet (one of your great advantages as a young person who isn't afraid of ""computer machines""); speak with others; circulate petitions or publish articles if necessary. It can be tiring; but this is how change happens. ",10,1
86,Read a poem.,A lot of us have misconceptions about poetry that date all the way back to high school. It's not just for pointy-headed intellectuals; and it's not just about trying to shove rambling stories into arbitrary rhythm and rhyme structures. The basic point of modern poetry is actually this: to make you feel something profound; in the most concise possible way. There's no room for BS or filler in poetry; not a word is wasted. That makes them fast; often very easy reads; that nonetheless can take you to the same place as a great novel or film. What better; more efficient way can there be to bring culture into your life? ,You may run into poetry now and then; but today's culture doesn't have much interest in it; so your best bet is to seek it out. Try the Poetry Foundation's website; which maintains a huge archive of really excellent and serious poetry (they even have an app; apparently) -- their Poem of the Day is an easy starting-place. ,2,1
87,Read an article.,These days; there's no excuse not to be informed. Unless you're in the practice of walking around in public with your eyes shut tight and your hands over your ears; it's basically impossible to avoid headlines online; on TV; and at newsstands. But how often do you actually take the time to read a whole article? If you actually read an entire article; you come away with a much deeper understanding of an issue than headlines and sound-bites can give you. To be the best citizen; professional; and parent you can be; you need to have all the facts.,Maybe easier said than done: just turn off all those tempting; blinkinBetween the Internet and print media; there are an abundance of ways to stay current on news; science; arts; and culture. Try bookmarking your favorite online magazine or subscribing to your favorite print periodical. If you're a Twitter or Facebook user; you shouldn't have to go too much further than your homepage to find an interesting shared article to investigate. g devices. From there; do what it takes to reconnect with reality. Have a (gasp!) face-to-face conversation; take a long walk; read a (paper) book; or start that creative project you've been putting off. ,2,1
88,Read daily from a book.,Whether you prefer the holy text of your faith or religious devotionals; a classic work of essays or advice; or any other piece of literature that's meaningful to you; there's enormous value in taking time every day to focus on a book. Not only is the quiet time of concentration good for your mind and emotions; but more importantly; it's always helpful to have a constant source of focus -- something to cut through the noise of the day and remind you of your basic values. ,Presuming you have a book in mind; the biggest challenge here is finding time. We all find ourselves in a hurry now and then; and something like reading is easy to skip. So build it into your routine. Many people like to do daily readings first thing in the morning or just before bed; when their minds are clear; find the time that works for you; and stick to it. ,3,1
89,Read the news.,"Part of being a good citizen is keeping in touch with your community and world. And that's harder than it used to be; what with all the crap ""news"" entertainment swirling around our televisions and Internet. ","We're using the word ""read"" deliberately -- the best news is still in newspapers. Your local paper is probably the only outlet reporting in detail on your community; nationally; try the New York Times or Wall Street Journal; and for world news the BBC is a solid choice. ",1,1
90,Read with a child.,Reading is one of the most important skills you need in life -- but for a kid; it can be tiresome and frustrating. Make it a positive experience by sharing a good book with a child; no matter their age. ,We're all used to reading to young children. But as kids get older; it's important to let them share the experience; and choose books that aren't overly easy or hard for them; let kids make their own literary discoveries; and just go along for the ride! ,3,1
91,Reduce your stress level.,Engineers will tell you that if you put enough stress on a structure -- like; say; a rope bridge trying to hold up a convoy of cement mixers -- that structure will break. Well; the same thing applies to humans. We need to be able to handle some stress (or else we wouldn't be very useful bridges) but too much stress will eventually tear us up; both mentally and physically. ,If you're like most people; you already know the best way for you to relax -- maybe you like to cool off with some good music; head out for exercise; or spend a satisfying evening with friends. The challenge is in finding the time; and in being able to focus on something other than your stress. So tell yourself: reducing stress is healthy and important; just like eating right and getting exercise. Actively prioritizing de-stressing will make you much more likely to succeed. ,2,1
92,Resist the impulse to buy.,Have you ever walked out of a store with; let's say; a $75 lamp? Only to realize later; on sober second thought; that you already have a lamp? Not only that; but your current lamp blends much better into your living room than your new lamp; by virtue of not being neon pink? Don't be that guy: studies have shown that you can save tons of money by forcing yourself to wait a week before making a major purchase. That way; you'll have a seven-day cooling-off period to realize how ugly that lamp actually was. ,"This sounds easy in principle; but when you're right there looking at the shiny object -- SHINY -- it's hard to tear your gaze away. (Stores usually don't help; by slapping colorful ""SALE!"" or ""CLEARANCE!"" stickers on things; in order to make you feel like the opportunity is temporary. It'll usually still be there a week later.) Use willpower; and be consistent with yourself; if you practice thoughtful shopping regularly; you'll get into the habit. ",3,1
93,Ride your bike.,"Bicycles are one of life's great improbabilities. Can you imagine inventing the bicycle? It takes a special kind of person to first envision two skinny rubber wheels; connected only by a random framework of metal tubes; and then say; ""Let's put a person on top of that."" Riding your bike pays tribute to that mad genius; and also happens to be very good exercise. /(For the record; that mad genius was a German baron named Karl von Drais; inventor of the ""velocipede"" or ""dandy horse;"" which had no pedals and required you to push it forward with your feet. We are not making any of that up.) ",Just head out around town (make sure you follow the rules of the road; because a collision between your bike and; let's say; a furniture truck is not going to end well for you); or look for an interesting bike trail (in which case; the furniture truck is less of a concern; but you may want to watch out for rodents such as squirrels and groundhogs; who have been known to lay fiendish bicyclist traps when peeved about something). ,5,1
94,Save 1% more.,1% of your paycheck doesn't sound like much -- because it isn't. You probably have at least that much in coins hiding under your car's floormat. But if you make a point of saving that money; it'll start adding up fast; and before you know it you'll have saved ELEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. You're rich! ,Most banks can automatically set up a monthly savings transfer for you. (They love it when you save money with them; because it is shiny and makes their tails wag.) Some employers can deposit part of your paycheck directly into savings; talk to your HR person. ,50,1
95,Save money.,We all have to buy things. No matter how you feel about it; things are part of our world -- we eat things; drink things; watch things; wear things; ride in things; and sleep on things; among other things. But we DON'T have to spend unnecessary money on those things! Potential savings are lurking behind almost everything you buy; if you don't take advantage of them; you might as well just be setting your money on fire.,"Step 1 is ""don't set your money on fire."" If you've got that part down; there is a whole world of bargain-hunting and coupon-clipping waiting for you to explore. Always plan ahead and comparison-shop -- are you getting the best value for your money? Is there a sale going on somewhere? Can you find coupons or discounts? What about online bidding or used items? ",3,1
96,Say no to soda.,"Whether you call it ""soda;"" ""pop;"" ""sody pop;"" or in rare cases Dr. Berzelius' Phosphate Tonic""; you know that soda's a guilty pleasure. It's laden with sugar; starch; caffeine; and empty calories. But you might not know that soda is widely considered to be one of the top contributors; possibly the top contributor; to our obesity epidemic. A whopping 10% of Americans' calorie intake comes from sweetened drinks like soda; and drinking it in that quantity seriously messes up your body's hormone balance (especially because our body often doesn't recognize calories in liquids as well as it does in foods; leading to overeating. Soda is among the only foods that has been conclusively; clinically; directly linked to weight gain. (And; by the way; diet soda doesn't help. It's marginally better calorie-wise but still is full of sweetener and has no nutritional value.) There is just no good reason anyone should drink this stuff. ","This is a ""just say no"" kind of deal. Don't buy it. Don't order it. Don't put it in your house. If offered; hurl it dramatically to the ground (note: do not do that). Instead choose water; perhaps an unsweetened fruit juice; or milk. ",1,1
97,Share inspiration.,Inspiration is universal. The idea that mankind can succeed -- that the complex and intimidating world around us can be understood; explored; and mastered -- is meaningful to absolutely everyone; regardless of the challenges they may face. We all find our inspiration in different ways and different places; to be sure; and what inspires one person may seem a hopeless cliche to another. But at its heart; the idea of inspiration is one that can profoundly affect us all. ,There's power in brevity. It's not by coincidence that inspirational quotes have become an industry unto themselves; they spread so widely because; by and large; they express inspiration in a condensed and highly potent way. Whether you prefer to take strength in others' ideas or formulate your own; find the thoughts that impact you most directly: then record them; keep them; and share them. ,2,1
98,Spend a day at the beach.,Improve your health with sun; exercise; and relaxation; then cancel it all out with a big plate of cheap fried food. This; friends; is the American Way; and at the beach we celebrate it. ,If you live near the coast; you really don't need our help with this. Landlocked? Look for lakes or ponds with public swimming. (In a pinch; create your own beach: use a very large drill near a major fault line; knock the neighboring portion of the continent into the sea; and boom! Instant beach. Do not try this without help from a certified comic-book supervillain.) ,10,1
99,Stay calm under pressure.,"As Queen and David Bowie remind us; we're all under pressure; ""pushing down on me; pressing down on you."" Keeping a level head in high-stress situations is difficult; but will ensure that you don't make decisions you'll later regret. You don't want to do something under pressure that ""splits a family in two; puts people on the streets."" So; go ahead and ""give love one more chance."" ","Many people successfully practice the old 'count to 10' method. We have a more intellectual one: ask yourself; ""What would The Incredible Hulk do?"" and then do not do that thing. Workplace pressure can be especially tough: to keep from getting all green and muscular at work; follow this advice from the perennially passionless Wall Street Journal. ",2,1
100,Stay hydrated during exercise.,When you're body's working -- and no; surfing the Internet does not count -- it needs fluid and fuel. Specifically; it needs the right balances of carbohydrates and electrolytes; for a number of complicated reasons. Here's just one: your muscles move because of electrical signals traveling from your nerves to their tissue. To keep those jolts of electricity firing properly; your body lines muscle tissue with chemicals like sodium and potassium that carry distinct electrical charges. When you exercise really hard; you start to lose these chemicals -- electrolytes (get it now?) -- through sweating or heavy breathing. If your body runs low on them; your nerves and muscles start to mess up; resulting in sudden fatigue or muscle spasms/cramps. Make sense? That should be reason enough to start watching your fluid intake during serious exercise. ,The kind of hydration you need depends on context. For lighter or briefer exercise; ordinary water will do just fine -- during activity; take a bottle with you and drink enough that you don't feel even a little bit thirsty. For athletes or people doing serious workouts of 60+ minutes; you may be better served by a fortified sports drink; which will help bring the carbohydrates and electrolytes you need. (Remember; no drink is a magic potion. If you ever begin to feel painful; weak; or light-headed during exercise; stop immediately.) ,1,1
101,Stick to a budget.,Your money is like a colony of ants. (Hear us out on this one.) If you just let it roam free; it might bring you some delicious crumbs of food; but most of it will wander away and disappear. That sucks! But if you carefully and deliberately organize it; keeping it in tunnels or wherever it is that ants live; it'll thrive and eventually grow. See? ,Depending on whether you want to organize ants or money; you will either need a really tiny shovel; or a good financial plan. There are lots of tools that can help you; but you'll have to do some tough thinking and pay close attention to your expenses. Don't worry; it gets easier once you've stuck to it for a while. ,25,1
102,Stretch.,There are a lot of misconceptions out there about stretching; and its benefits haven't been consistently proven. That being said; if you do them safely and consistently; stretches are a satisfying part of an exercise routine; and can increase your flexibility; making you more effective at athletics and other exercises and reducing the likelihood of injury. ,It's important to do stretches right -- the Mayo Clinic's advice is solid here. Warm up first (stretching cold muscles isn't a good idea); and hold them (30 seconds is a good timeframe per stretch) rather than bouncing or straining. If you feel pain; stop. Focus on stretching the muscles you use most; like calves; neck and shoulders; lower back; and hips; as well as whatever muscles you use regularly in exercise. If you need a place to start; try these basic stretches. ,5,1
103,Study another language.,Speaking in a different language is like a full-body workout for your brain -- keeps it quick and nimble; like a cat; or a ninja. (Or a ninja cat.) Plus it'll be helpful if you ever want to visit a foreign country without looking like a doofus. ,Depending on how deeply you want to get into it; you can focus on learning some basic phrases -- or just one -- or; try a language course or some software. ,10,1
104,Study for school.,Oh come on; you know exactly why you should be studying. Ask your mother. ,For many of us; the way to study is simply to not do anything else. (We're looking at you; Facebook.) If you're struggling with studying effectively; though; there are many strategies you can try; here is an exhaustive guide that features many colorful comics. ,1,1
105,Take a break.,Whether you're a kid on a school bus; a guy playing basketball; or half of a set of adorable twins; this iconic 1980s Kit Kat commercial supports your right to take a break. As it happens; research does too. Taking periodic breaks during sedentary or repetitive tasks actually increases your overall productivity; and breaks that involve standing up or moving around enhance that impact because they carry health benefits as well. ,Take one short break per hour to stand up and stretch or grab something you need. When you're at work; running errands in the car; or spending the day taking care of things around the house; you should try to take several longer breaks that involve a short stroll or light conversation. The Kit Kat is optional; but a fabulous 80s outfit is highly recommended. ,1,1
106,Take a challenging class.,College isn't just about finding the shortest possible path between you and your degree. You have the opportunity to really push yourself -- to develop the skills and confidence you need to face a serious intellectual challenge. This will happen in your professional and personal life; and it's helpful to be prepared. ,"This isn't just about picking your courses (although that's part of it -- don't indulge in ""Basket-Weaving 101"" or ""The American Television Comedy: An In-Depth Study"" too often). Many classes present the opportunity for challenge if you'll only take it: actually do the reading instead of relying on a study guide; and try to understand the material rather than just memorizing and BSing. ",10,1
107,Take a deep breath.,Deep breathing is like a massage for your whole body. Your diaphragm settles; relaxing your lungs and improving blood flow; while cooling off your nervous system and easing stress. Studies have shown that breathing well has all kinds of positive consequences for our health; plus; you know; oxygen is nice. ,"Relax your upper body and just go ""aaaaahhhhhhhhhhh."" Take your time. See how easy this is? ",1,1
108,Take a vacation.,Work; as a rule; is stressful. We can do a lot to manage and ease the stress that comes with work; and it's critically important to this throughout the working year; but not much is quite as effective as a good vacation. Getting away from work -- and yes; this includes emails; which should never follow you to your vacation site -- is a tried-and-true way to reconnect with your family; yourself; and everything else that work usually pushes aside. The simple fact is that a good vacation makes you a healthier person and a more productive employee: that's worth celebrating! ,"Many high-stress workplaces; especially in the United States; look at vacationing with a bit of distaste; and they encourage you to stockpile vacation days for some future time when you'll ""really need it"". Ignore that. You deserve your vacation; and you should take it with pride: even if you choose to just have a ""staycation;"" spending quality time with your family and your house; that's your prerogative. Don't feel obligated to check in with work; either: you can't rest the portions of your brain that are stressed by work if you're still obsessively checking your BlackBerry. ",15,1
109,Take photographs.,Your life is ready for its close-up! Photography awakens your creativity and gives you an opportunity to look at the world differently. When you take a photo; you appreciate the beauty of your subject matter and hone your critical eye. Photos are also a valuable* way to document the people; places; events; etc. that are most important to you. Later on; you'll be glad you have a powerful visual record to anchor your memories and add personality to your home or office.,Quality digital cameras are available at varying price points--you may already have a decent one in your smartphone. Going digital makes photos easy to snap; upload; edit; and share. But if you've seriously caught the bug; try learning how to shoot and develop your own real-film images. / *A picture is usually worth a thousand words; but a picture sent via text message is sometimes only worth three letters (OMG!). ,3,1
110,Take the stairs.,Elevators are boring and awkward. STAIRS are healthy; invigorating; and danceable!,Climbing stairs generally requires feet; although you're welcome to use hands instead if that's how you roll. ,3,1
111,Talk with your partner.,Relationships thrive on communication. Every couple can; and should; talk through their issues; both big and small -- whether you're ready to profess eternal love; or just ready to ask if you can maybe get whole-grain pasta this time; an open and heartfelt conversation makes a relationship stronger. ,Naturally this depends on the issue and the context; and it's up to you to find the best way to converse. Some couples actually plan appointments with each other to talk through sensitive or difficult issues dispassionately; others find that they think most clearly in restaurants; or on walks; or while barreling down the Santa Monica Freeway at 90 MPH with several hundred police officers on their tail. (We don't endorse that last one.) Point being; it's up to you to start the conversation; and then to speak honestly and openly about your feelings -- be honest; be fair; be understanding; listen as much as you talk; and you'll reach a good conclusion. ,10,1
112,Teach your kid(s).,Let's leave this one to Crosby; Stills; & Nash. (Executive summary: they'll teach you back later.),You don't have to be a home schooler to be a home educator. Start simple: read together. (Why not explore the library and find something you both like?) If you've got a skill that your child might enjoy; whether it's dribbling a basketball or programming the DVR; practice it together; or try educational activities; which can be found at all kinds of toy and teaching supply stores. ,10,1
113,Train for an event.,The human spirit craves athletic competition. Admit it: you get super excited you when you hear the Olympic theme music. Maybe you're not exactly Olympic material; but there are still plenty of ways for regular folks to perform public feats of strength. Organized athletic events like marathons and half-marathons give you the opportunity to strut your stuff; but they also serve as an important end goal to motivate you through a challenging exercise routine. Choose an event happening a few months from now and plan your training schedule with the date in mind. ,An abbreviated list of upcoming world athletic events; by order of awesomeness: the Sumo Run; Wife Carrying World Championship; The Santa Speedo Run; Iron Man World Championship. If none of those are your cup of tea (OK; fine; but why not?) do some research. In most metro areas; it's easy enough to find an event that will give you the dual opportunity to stay fit and help out a good cause. / Once you've chosen an event; you'll need to do some research about the best ways to train. Check out this advice from Runner's World. Apparently there's more to it than just running until you're too tired to run any more... ,10,1
114,Try a new food.,Food is incredible. There is SO MUCH good food out there; and you have probably never heard of most of it. Healthy surprises await if you branch out and try something new. ,Is there a new family-owned restaurant in your neighborhood? Or; at the supermarket; take time to look around - focus on the ethnic food aisle or; if you have one; the natural/organic section - and pick something interesting. ,2,1
115,Try a new workout.,It's time to step out of the same old boring workout box. Here's the thing: the more you enjoy exercise; the more likely you are to do it. Finding a new workout that really excites you will help you stay motivated and make you happier. Plus; when you repeat the same workout over and over; you'll find that the results diminish. To keep your body in its best shape; you need to vary types of exercise to target all of your major muscle groups. ,If you've been living under a rock for the past twenty years or so; we're here to tell you that there are currently more ways to work out than there are ways to eat a Reese's. From your standard fare of jogging or aerobics to more creative options like Pilates; rock-climbing; spinning; or our personal favorite; Zumba (it's salsa in your sweatpants! But this time with other people there to validate you!) -- there's got to be something you haven't tried yet. ,15,1
116,Try something new.,Nobody likes to be stuck in a rut. Our brains certainly don't -- without exercise; our brains start to melt just like unused muscles. Getting out of your comfort zone is a great way to keep yourself on your toes (not literally; unless your new thing happens to be ballet).,Adventures are all around you; but they're probably not in your house. Go out: check your local newspaper's events listing to find something that intrigues you; like a dance class or a community festival; or just talk to your friends and learn how they spend their time. The key thing is to keep an open mind -- if you only try things you already know you like; it's a slippery slope back to the couch eating Fritos again. ,2,1
117,Tuck your child into bed.,Do you remember your bedtime rituals? For many people; these comforting moments were among the calmest and happiest moments of childhood; it's a perfect opportunity for parents to express love and caring in an immediate yet profound way. Possibly because the kid's conscious mind is already shutting down for sleep; so they're placid and impressionable -- but let's not be so cynical about it; okay? Come on. ,Just follow your heart -- and your kid -- with this one. Even if you only have 30 seconds before you have to rush off to the next thing; you have time to tell your child you love them; make sure they're comfortable; and turn off the lights. Feel free; also; to try singing; reading; praying; storytelling; or just talking together. It might seem cheesy; that's because it IS cheesy; but your child will thank you later. ,2,1
118,Turn off unused lights.,Today we're faced with a challenge: to reduce our use of energy; or else face severe consequences for our ability to survive amid depleted resources and a warming planet. Your own household budget; your community; and even wildlife could benefit immediately if we commit to making daily changes in our use of energy; this starts with ending waste in your home. ,Make the pledge to save energy! Switch off TVs; computers; lights; and other appliances that are not being used; and unplug items like phone chargers that consume electricity even when not in use. Also; replace any incandescent light bulbs you might have with fluorescent bulbs to save even more energy! See what else you can do. ,2,1
119,Upgrade your birth control.,"Getting pregnant; for many people; is easy. And not the good; convenient kind of easy -- the unexpected; ""woah"" kind of easy. It happens. If you're having sex; but not interested in having a baby just yet; then consider a birth control upgrade. ",Birth control is always improving. Find out if there's a newer; longer lasting; more effective method that fits your lifestyle and works well with your body. LARCs (long acting reversible contraceptives) are some of the most reliable methods available; but you have lots of options. Explore birth control. Select the best one. Use it consistently (that part's important). And; well; have fun. ,15,1
120,Use a car seat safely.,Cars are pretty awesome; but for a small child; the car is no place to play. Keeping your kid safely restrained in the car is an absolutely essential part of car safety; seatbelts and airbags are NOT designed to protect children; and in fact can be very dangerous to kids in an accident. Without a proper car seat; any collision (or even a bad bump) puts your kid at risk. ,It depends on the age of your child; of course; the key thing is that you use your car seat consistently; according to the guidelines laid out by NHTSA; and for heaven's sake make sure your car seat hasn't been recalled or damaged: register it with the manufacturer; search for recalls; or get a free inspection. ,2,1
121,Use coupons.,Coupons are like tiny; colorful; free money. (Think; like; Monopoly money. Or Canadian money.) Would you pass up free money? No; you would not. ,They come in all shapes and sizes; and they're lurking everywhere. Some coupons just throw themselves at you; camping out in your mailbox or leaping towards you at the checkout counter. Others require digging; from paging through coupon-collecting websites (of which there are lots) to grabbing those flyers by the supermarket door. Whether you're a full-time coupon clipper (of whom the best have been known to save thousands of dollars a year) or just use 'em when you've got 'em; coupons are a powerful path to savings. Just use them carefully: don't fall into the all-too-common trap of buying unnecessary stuff just because you have a coupon. 55 cents off does not justify spending $3 on; for example; clam juice. YOU ARE NEVER GOING TO USE THAT CLAM JUICE ANYWAY. Stay strong... ,2,1
122,Use fuel-efficient things.,Fuel costs money. And money; in most cases; is valuable -- that means it can be used to buy other things that are neither money nor fuel; for example; candy. Don't you like candy? ,Look for certifications such as Energy Star on any appliance you buy; and always research your purchases. If you're in the automobile market; choose a better MPG whenever possible (remember to factor in the amount of city; as vs. highway; driving you do) and consider a hybrid (you'll pay more up front; and maintenance costs aren't predictable yet over the long term; but you're likely to save an ongoing heap of gas money). ,3,1
123,Use or share a healthy recipe.,Healthy eating is a recipe for success; but it can be a long trip from Nutritious Ingredientsville to Edible Dinnerburg. Without a good road map; lots of families wind up taking a wrong turn on Steaming Pile Of Mysterious Grainy Stuff Street; or This Kind Of Tastes Like Newspaper Avenue; and end up pulling off at the Screw It; Let's Just Get Pizza Again Motel. You don't have to be a cooking pro to whip up a delicious meal from high-nutrient foods; but if a picky eater often creates scenes like this at your dinner table; you'll want to follow a tried-and-true recipe (or else spend an hour picking quinoa out of the carpet). ,If you're a veteran healthy chef; share your tricks for creating balanced meals; right here and wherever else you can. If you're a newbie to preparing foods like tofu; kale; and sweet potato; though; you're best off following a roadmap -- and this being the Internet age; your computer is basically a culinary GPS. There are plenty of recipes available on the Food Network's site; for starters; or try the Mayo Clinic or Eating Well. ,5,1
124,Visit an art gallery.,Don't be intimidated - art galleries exist specifically for people to go look at art. You don't need a degree in fine arts to appreciate a good painting or an interesting sculpture; no matter your background; experiencing good art is a beautiful and profound experience.,There are basically two kinds of art galleries: art museums; and galleries that display art for sale. Both encourage you to just walk in and look around (there is no obligation to buy anything); although you can probably spend more time in a good art museum. ,10,1
125,Visit the library.,Libraries are curious places. In many communities; they symbolize both the past and the future: libraries contain humongous quantities of knowledge; often dating back centuries or more; and exploring them often takes on the air of archaeology; yet at the same time for many people they're the best (or only) available access to computers and the Internet. Today's libraries walk a tightrope between those two purposes; and today's librarians do an incredible job of helping both kids and adults discover the world of knowledge; at an unthinkably low price. How amazing is that? ,Find a public library near you (any search engine will do) and just explore. Read; discover; and expand your horizons! Taking your kids to the library; in particular; is an affordable and responsible way to help them build foundations in reading; learning; and discovery. ,5,1
126,Visit the zoo.,Animals are cooler than people. It's just a fact. So maybe if you hang out with them for a little while; some of their glory will rub off on you. Possibly they'll throw it at you. ,Find your local zoo; check its hours (sometimes they change by season); and head over! They would love your company. ,5,1
127,Walk the dog.,Imagine if you could only go to the bathroom on someone else's schedule. Would you wait as patiently as your dog does? THAT'S HOW MUCH YOUR DOG LOVES YOU. ,Leash. Door. Coat (if necessary). Walk. Scoop. Home. That's it! ,2,1
128,Work on quitting smoking.,Remember the Indonesian smoking baby? These days; even he is trying to quit. The health risks of smoking are long established and well publicized. (If you slept through high school health class; check out this CDC fact sheet on smoking's harmful effects.) Assuming you aren't trying to increase your risk for lung cancer by a factor of 20; you know why you need to summon the willpower to quit -- especially if you're a parent! ,"Try stepping out for an apple instead. Yes: turn to friends at a party and casually say; ""I'm just going to pop out for an apple."" You'll be the healthiest person on the sidewalk!...If that doesn't work for some unfathomable reason; there does seem to be a most effective approach to getting the monkey off your back. According to thorough research by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services; successful quitters need a combination of counseling; a doctor's support; and medication (generally involving nicotine replacement). When you're ready; call a support line like 1-800-QUIT-NOW for free; immediate counseling. Then set up a doctor's appointment to plan next steps. ",10,1
129,Work out.,"You know that overwhelming happy feeling you get after intense exercise? That's an endorphin rush; your body's way of saying ""THANK YOU; I NEEDED THAT."" Your body knows what's up: exercise keeps us strong; fit; and confident. ",No gym? No equipment? No problem - and no excuse. Anyone can work out; right in their living room. Whether you're sweating in front of your TV or at the gym; the main thing is just to find an exercise routine that's right for your fitness level -- try to find one that leaves you tired but not exhausted (totally draining your energy doesn't help anything); and motivated to do it again. And we mean this: talk to your doctor before starting a new fitness routine. ,10,1
130,Work standing up.,"Our bodies were not made for sitting down. Some researchers are beginning to argue that chairs rank right up there with lead paint and double cheeseburgers on the list of ""human inventions that totally backfire on our health"" -- and whether you buy the claim that they're actively killing you or not; it's still the case that being sedentary for long periods of time is no good for your heart or your weight. Standing up during the time when you'd otherwise be sitting helps you burn more calories; prevent ergonomic strain; and feel better about your workday. ",Many of you will have jobs that you're actually supposed to do standing up; in which case this feat is a gimme (and you probably know all about how difficult it actually is). Assuming you're a desk worker; you can go to the extreme and get yourself a standing desk (see if your employer will pay for one; they're awfully expensive). More and more people are endorsing those desks; though they can be surprisingly painful on the first day (as your body adjusts to long periods of standing) and you'll likely need to wear comfortable shoes. Otherwise; try just taking a break now and then to stand -- anything you can do without sitting down; such as phone calls or pad-and-pencil planning; merits a quick stand or a walk down the hall. ,2,1
131,Write.,Expressing your thoughts in words is a cognitively and emotionally challenging task; but it's a very satisfying one to do well (not to mention potentially a very useful one at your job; the ability to write a coherent email or report is prized in many businesses). It helps you deconstruct your thoughts; explore your ideas; and share them with people around the world; there's a reason that written language is so fundamental to our day-to-day life. By writing; you're actually contributing to the advancement of the human race! ,"They say ""a writer writes."" (By ""they"" we of course mean ""Billy Crystal in the 1989 dark comedy Throw Momma From The Train;"" as we usually do.) Whether you make a living from the written word; keep a blog with a small but loyal readership; are quietly plugging away at the next postmodern masterpiece; or just like to collect your thoughts in a journal -- it doesn't matter. A writer writes. Carve out some time in your day to work on whatever strikes your fancy; don't obsess about it being good; or complete. Don't even save it if you don't want to. Just practice; and hone your authorial skills. ",2,1
